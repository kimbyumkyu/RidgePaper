%In recent years, similar features between small systems like proton-proton (pp) collisions and large systems like lead-lead collisions have been observed via long-range correlations in pseudorapidity (so-called the ridge) for pairs of charged hadrons. Many theoretical approaches have been applied to interpret the similarity. However, it is still controversial whether the ridge in small systems is originated from initial or final-state effects of the collision.

To further investigate the ridge effect in small systems, we present the new results of long-range correlations as a function of transverse momentum of jets in very high-multiplicity pp collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV with ALICE. The study benefit from a dedicated high-multiplicity trigger implemented in ALICE since 2016. Jet events are selected by two methods. The first one is done by seeing the transverse momentum of  leading particle in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<0.9$. The second method is done by reconstruction of charged jets using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm with resolution parameter $R=0.4$ in $|\eta_\mathrm{jet}|<0.4$. The measured ridge yield is consistent with the previous results from other LHC experiments. Furthermore, the ridge yield is found to be independent of the energy scale of the hard scattering process. This observation can help identify the origins of the ridge in small systems.
