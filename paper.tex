Long-range azimuthal correlations are measured in very high-multiplicity pp collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV by ALICE at LHC. 
These results are obtained in a relative pseudorapidity range of $1.6 < |\eta| < 1.8$ and transverse momentum region of $1 < p_{\mathrm T} < 5$~GeV/$c$ for the trigger and associated particles.
In addition to the conventional long-range correlation studies, the results are further investigated in events, where jets with a harder fragmentation are present.
The jets are reconstructed by using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm with resolution parameter $R=0.4$ in $|\eta_\mathrm{jet}|<0.4$. 
The magnitude of the correlation dubbed ridge yield, is consistent with the results from other LHC experiments for unbiased events. 
These correlations also persist in the events containing jets. Furthermore data show that the ridge yields tend to increase in events holding $\ptjet > 10$~GeV/$c$.
The results are compared to $\pythiashoving$, EPOS and A Multi-Phase Transport ({AMPT}) model calculations.  
$\pythiashoving$ model can describe low $p_{\mathrm T}$  ridge yields but can't give good description of  $p_{\mathrm T}$ dependence both for the unbiased and jet events.
The results open new aspects of studying the small collision systems with jet tagged events in the future and will help to explore possible physical origins of long-range correlations.
