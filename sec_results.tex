\section {Results}
\label{sec:results}

The two-dimensional associated yield per trigger particle is shown in Figure 1 for pairs of trigger particle and associated particle with 1.0$<\it{p}_{\rm{T, assoc}}<\it{p}_{\rm{T, trig}}<$2.0 GeV/\it{c}\rm{} in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\it{s}} = $\unit{13} {\rm{}TeV} in the 0-0.1\% (left), 5-20\% (middle) and 20-100\% (right) multiplicity class estimated by V0 detector, which covers forward rapidity region. The ridge is clearly seen in high multiplicity class unlike in lower multiplicity classes.

The one-dimensional $\Delta\varphi$ distribution is shown in Figure 2 for pairs of particles with various $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}$ intervals in very high multiplicity class. The associated yield per trigger particle is compared with CMS results. The near-side peak is highest in the 1.0$<\it{p}_{\rm{T}}<$2.0 interval and gradually decreases with increasing $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}$.

The spectra of the ridge yield is shown in Figure 3 in very high multiplicity class and compared with CMS results. The estimator of particle multiplicity of ALICE is done with forward subsystem(V0), whereas that of CMS is done by mid-rapidity particles meeting with the condition of $|\eta|<$2.4 and $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}>$0.4 GeV/\it{c}\rm{}. Dedicated comparison is conducted and the difference of particle multiplicity is estimated to be about 20\%. Taking into account the difference in acceptance of charged tracks and comparable definition of multiplicity,, the measurements are can be considered comparable with each other.

To further understand the behavior of the ridge in events including hard processes, the two-dimensional associated yield per trigger particle is measured with the leading track selection as shown in Figure 4. The ridge is still visible in the events where $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}^{\rm{Lead}}>$7 GeV/c, which means that the ridge co-exists with hard-scattering in pp collisions. 

The one-dimensional $\Delta\varphi$ distribution with the leading track selection is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotDeltaPhiESE}. The near-side yield doesn't change with respect to the leading track requirements within the uncertainties, whereas the away-side peak increases as the leading track requirement gets stronger, presumably because of the increase of the recoil jet yield.

The ridge yield is inspected as a function of the leading track selection in Fig.~\ref{fig:RidgeYield_ESE}. As seen in the previous plots, the ridge yield does not depend on the selection, which indicates that the ridge is not affected significantly by the hardness of the events.
