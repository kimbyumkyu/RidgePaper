Figure~\ref{fig:PlotCorrMBHMT} shows two-particle correlation functions as functions of the $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \varphi$ between the trigger and associated particles. The functions are measured with Eq.~\ref{eq:corrfunction} for $1 < \pttrig~\mathrm (\ptassoc) < 2$ GeV/$c$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\it{s}} = $\unit{13} {\rm{}TeV}. The left panel is for the 0--0.1\% multiplicity class. The right one is from the minimum bias events (0--100\% multiplicity class). The ridge structure is clearly observed in the high multiplicity class while it is not seen in the minimum bias events. The away side is dominant from the correlation of back to back jet.

Projected $\Delta\varphi$ distributions of the two-particle correlation functions in $1.6<|\Delta\eta|<1.8$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotDeltaPhi} for various $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}$ intervals in the minimum bias class (0--100\%) and the high multiplicity class (0--0.1\%). The near-side ($\Delta\varphi\sim 0$) peak in 0--0.1\% multiplicity class is clearly observed in all transverse momentum ranges studied while there is no hint of signal in the minimum bias class. The near-side peak is highest in the interval of $1<\it{p}_{\rm{T}}<2$ GeV/$c$ and gradually decreases with increasing $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}$ in the high multiplicity class. The measurements in the high multiplicity class are compared to the results measured by the CMS collaboration~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lva}. The near-side peaks in all transverse momentum ranges are comparable each other within the uncertainties. The larger away yields observed in \cite{Khachatryan:2015lva} can be attributed to the difference in $\eta$ acceptances. The model predictions are presented for the measurements in the high multiplicity class with the same acceptances used in this article both for $\eta$ and event multiplicity. The high multiplicity class for each model is determined by requiring the minimum number of charged particles are larger than 105, which is corresponding to the top 0--0.1\% multiplicity class based on $\pythiam$. The $\pythiashoving$ gives good estimates of the near-side peak and slightly overestimates the away-side yield for the interval of $1<\it{p}_{\rm{T}}<2$ GeV/$c$. However the $\pythiashoving$ underestimates the near-side peak for the $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}>2$ GeV/$c$ range. $\pythiam$ does not show any peaks in the near-side as expected and slightly underestimates the away-side peak for $1<\it{p}_{\rm{T}}<2$ GeV/$c$ and gives good estimates for the $\it{p}_{\rm{T}}>2$ GeV/$c$ range, which mainly come from the back to back jet correlations.

The ridge yields as a function of the transverse momentum are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotYSpect} in the high multiplicity class and compared to \cite{Khachatryan:2015lva}. The particle multiplicity in this analysis is estimated with the forward subsystem (V0), whereas that in \cite{Khachatryan:2015lva}  used the mid-rapidity particles in $|\eta|<$2.4 and $\pt>0.4$ GeV/$c$. By interpolating the $\eta$ and $\pt{}$ distributions based on PYTHIA, it is found that the multiplicity in \cite{Khachatryan:2015lva} is about 20\% higher than 0--0.1\% in this analysis, corresponding 0--0.03\%. Taking into account the differences in acceptance of charged tracks and estimated multiplicity, the measurements are comparable with each other. The spectrum is also compared with model calculations. $\pythiam$ gives zero yields since it does not contain the ridge effect. $\pythiashoving$ describes the yield qualitatively however its yield decreases more rapidly than the experimental measurement as $\pttrigassoc$ increases.

\subsection{Event-scale dependence of the ridge yield}
\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{ Two-dimensional correlations function as function of $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$ in top 0-0.1\% multiplicity class with the minimum $\ptlead$ (left) or $\ptjet$ (right) selection. The interval of $\pttrig$ and $\ptassoc$ is $1<\pt<2$ GeV/$c$. The minimum requirement for $\ptlead$ or $\ptjet$ is 9 or 10 GeV/$c$, respectively. }
	\label{fig:PlotCorrHMTSel}
\end{figure}

The ridge yield is further studied with respect to two different event scales of the hard processes. Event-scale measurement by the largest $\pt$ of particles in each event that is denoted as $\ptlead$ while the other is done by reconstructing jets and measuring their transverse momenta, represented as $\ptjet$. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PlotCorrHMTSel}, the ridge structure for $1< \pttrig\,(\ptassoc) <2$ GeV/$c$ still persists in high multiplicity pp collisions with $\ptlead>9$ (left) or $\ptjet>10$~GeV/$c$ (right) .  %The interval is the same to the measured ridge yield is maximum without the event-scale selection.
It is worth noting that the correlation function with the minimum $\ptjet$ selection has double peaks along the $\Delta\eta$ axis at $\Delta\varphi = \pi$ due to the limited jet acceptance by requiring a minimum $\ptjet$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{./figures/Fig5_PlotDeltaPhiESE.pdf}
	\caption{ One-dimensional $\Delta\varphi$ distribution in the large $\Delta\eta$ with the minimum $\ptlead$(lower) or $\ptjet$(upper) selection for $1< \pttrig~\mathrm (\ptassoc) <2$ GeV/$c$ in the 0--0.1\% multiplicity class. The filled circles show measurement with ALICE. Model predictions are compared with measurement with a blue line for $\pythiashoving$  and a orange line for $\pythiam$.}
	\label{fig:PlotDeltaPhiESE}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:PlotDeltaPhiESE} shows projected $\Delta\varphi$ distributions of the correlation functions in $1.6<|\Delta\eta|<1.8$ with the minimum $\ptlead$ (lower) and $\ptjet$ (upper). Even with the event scale selection, the ridge is still visible in near-side. The near-side yield increases as the threshold of $\ptjet$ increases compared to one in unbiased events, while the ridge yields for an increasing threshold of $\ptlead$ increase less than those of $\ptjet$. The event-scale measurement with $\ptlead$ favors harder jets as a leading particle carries a large fraction of the momentum. In contrast, soft jets are favored for reconstructed jets. The results are compared with $\pythiashoving$ and $\pythiam$ calculations. $\pythiashoving$ can still reproduce the near-side peak, while underestimating the yield with the event scale selections. On the other hand, $\pythiam$ does not show the near-side peak with the event scale selections. Both models describe the away-side yield with the $\ptjet$ selection and overestimate away-side yield with the $\ptlead$ selection.

\end{figure}

Finally, the ridge yields as functions of the minimum $\ptlead$ ($\it{p}^{\rm{LP}}_{\rm{T,min}}$) and $\ptjet$ ($\it{p}^{\rm{Jet}}_{\rm{T,min}}$) selections are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RidgeYield_ESE}. The ridge yields are increased for $\it{p}^{\rm{LP}}_{\rm{T,min}} >$ 7 and $\it{p}^{\rm{Jet}}_{\rm{T,min}} \ge$ 10~GeV/$c$ compared to one from the unbiased events. A moderate increase of the ridge yields toward higher $\ptlead$ or $\ptjet$ is observed and there is no difference between two event selections within the uncertainties.
The results are compared with $\pythiashoving$ and $\pythiam$. $\pythiashoving$ doesn't show a clear $\it{p}^{\rm{LP}}_{\rm{T,min}}$ or $\it{p}^{\rm{Jet}}_{\rm{T,min}}$ dependence within the errors and underestimates the yields especially for the jet tagged events. $\pythiam$ does not produce the ridge yield, estimating zero yield, which imply the negligible jet contamination in the measurements.
The origin of the enhanced ridge yields for higher momentum jet tagged events is not clear to date but it might be related with the expected shorter impact parameters for dijet or multi-jet production events studied in~\cite{Frankfurt:2010ea}.
