\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}

Two-particle angular correlations in large $|\Delta\eta|$ has been measured in very high multiplicity events in pp collsions at $\sqrt{\it{s}}=13$ TeV with ALICE. The measured associated yield is found to be consistent with the previous results from CMS experiment. The ridge yield, for the first time, has been observed in events including hard processes. Furthermore, it is found to be independent of the hardness of the events. This observation is important for the study of the origins of the ridge in small collision systems.
