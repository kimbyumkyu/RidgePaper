\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. These results are obtained in a relative pseudorapidity range of $1.6 < |\eta| < 1.8$ and transverse momentum region of $1 < p_{\mathrm T} < 5$~GeV/$c$ for the trigger and associated particles and 0--0.1\% multiplicity event class. 
The results are compatible to the measurements by the CMS collaboration~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lva}.
%In addition, the $\pt$ and the $\it{p}_{\rm{T,Lead}}$ or $\it{p}_{\rm{T,Jet}}$ selection dependence of the long-range azimuthal correlations are measured.
PYTHIA8 string shoving quantitatively estimates the spectrum while $\pythiam$ shows zero yield. Further the ridge yields are studied in events, where jets with harder fragmentations is to be present by requiring the $\it{p}_{\rm{T,Lead}}$ or $\it{p}_{\rm{T,Jet}}$. The ridge structure still persist with both selections. The ridge yield with hard fragmentations($p_{\mathrm T, jet} > 10$~GeV/$c$) has shown the enhancement as the $\it{p}_{\rm{T,Lead}}$ or $\it{p}_{\rm{T,Jet}}$ increases. The results are compared with $\pythiashoving$ calculations, showing the enhancement while underestimating the absolute ridge yield.
